# 03 :- What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?

### RDBMS :- (Data stored is in table format) (Multiple data elements are accessible together) (Data in the form of a table are linked together) (Normalisation is not achievable) (Support distributed database) (Data is stored in a large amount) (Here, redundancy of data is reduced with the help of key and indexes in RDBMS) (RDBMS supports multiple users) (It features multiple layers of security while handling data)

### DBMS :- (Data stored is in the file format) (Individual access of data elements) (No connection between data) (There is normalisation) (No support for distributed database) (Data stored is a small quantity) (Data redundancy is common) (DBMS supports a single user) (There is only low security while handling data) 

# 04 :- What is MF Cod Rule of RDBMS Systems? 
### ANSWER :- Codd's twelve rules are a set of thirteen rules (numbered zero to twelve) proposed by Edgar F. Codd, a pioneer of the relational model for databases, designed to define what is required from a database management system in order for it to be considered relational, i.e., a relational database management system (RDBMS).

# 05 :- What do you understand By Data Redundancy? 
### ANSWER :- Data redundancy occurs when the same piece of data exists in multiple places, whereas data inconsistency is when the same data exists in different formats in multiple tables. Unfortunately, data redundancy can cause data inconsistency, which can provide a company with unreliable and/or meaningless information. 

# 06 :- What is DDL Interpreter? 
### ANSWER :- It interprets DDL statements and record them in tables containing metadata. Its a language in database through which you can make the logical design of the schemas ....

# 07 :- What is DML Compiler in SQL?
### ANSWER :- SQL uses specific commands like Create, Drop, Insert, etc., to carry out the required tasks. DML is an abbreviation for Data Manipulation Language. Represents a collection of programming languages explicitly used to make changes to the database, such as: CRUD operations to create, read, update and delete data.

# 08 :- What is SQL Key Constraints writing an Example of SQL Key Constraints?
### ANSWER :- In this tutorial, we'll learn about constraints in SQL with the help of examples. In a database table, we can add rules to a column known as constraints. These rules control the data that can be stored in a column.For example, if a column has NOT NULL constraint, it means the column cannot store NULL values.
